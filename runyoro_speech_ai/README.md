# Runyoro Speech AI Project

This project aims to develop robust Artificial Intelligence capabilities for the Runyoro language, starting with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and laying the groundwork for future speech generation (Text-to-Speech) and natural language understanding (NLU).

## Project Phases (High-Level)

1.  **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:** Automated pipeline for acquiring and preparing Runyoro audio data.
2.  **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) Model Training:** Pre-training a model on unlabeled Runyoro audio.
3.  **ASR Fine-tuning:** Fine-tuning the SSL model for speech recognition.
4.  **Inference System:** CLI/API for transcribing Runyoro audio.
5.  **Documentation & Scalability:** Comprehensive docs and cloud scaling plan.
